# Paper List about "LLM + Table"
Different types of tables are widely used by individual users or companies to store information. To automatically process amounts of tables and gain valuable insights, researchers have proposed a series of deep-learning models for various table-related tasks, e.g., table question answering and table-to-text. Recently, the emerging Large Language Models (LLM) have opened up new possibilities for processing tabular data. In this repository, we collect papers and applications on the combination of "LLM and table-related tasks", e.g., using LLM for table QA or table-to-text.
